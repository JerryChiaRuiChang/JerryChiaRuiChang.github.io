Please use the tabs at the top of the page for more information on my projects, CV, and music.\nI am originally from Taipei, Taiwan. I grew up playing the piano and participated in competitions both internationally and locally. Though my plan was to go to music conservatory for college, I decided to explore options outside of music. I have always found some interesting connections between music and mathematics, where technical training in music led me to think logically and quantitatively. I ended up studying Statistical Science with a minor in Computer Science at Duke University.\nAt Duke, I had the opportunities to work with amazing faculties in the Duke Statistical Science department, including Dr. Jerome Reiter, Dr. Fan Li, and Dr. Cynthia Rudin. These experiences sparked my interest in the intersection of statistics and public health, which led me to graduate schools and to biostatistics.\nCurrently, I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Rui Wang, where my research aims to develop novel statistical methods to address challenges in the design and analysis of clinical trials. In particular, my research concerns with (1) improving validity — the ability to produce statistically credible results and infer cause-effect relationships — of clinical trials in the face of complex trial designs and missing data challenges and (2) enhancing external validity — the extent to which trial results can be generalized/transported to some target population of interests, which may systematically differ from the original trial population due to inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nOutside of school, I continue playing the piano. You can find my performance in the music tab. I am also a big foodie and enjoy cooking and trying out restaurants during my spare time.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://JerryChiaRuiChang.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H.
